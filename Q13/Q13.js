//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
var my_own_array = ["Motorcycle", "Train", "Aeroplane", "Car", "Bus"];
var message3 = "I would like to travel by ";
console.log(message3 + my_own_array[0]);
console.log(message3 + my_own_array[1]);
console.log(message3 + my_own_array[2]);
console.log(message3 + my_own_array[3]);
console.log(message3 + my_own_array[4]);
